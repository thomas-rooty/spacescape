# Space Scape

Welcome to Space Scape, a survival game set in the year 2300 where the Earth has become uninhabitable and the remaining survivors have fled to space in search of a new habitable planet.

As the protagonist, Jacob, an engineer in survival systems, you find yourself alone on a damaged spaceship, struggling to keep vital systems running. You soon realize that energy, water, and food resources are critical and that you must find a solution quickly before the ship is destroyed.

With your technical knowledge and determination, you begin to repair the damaged systems and maximize the use of remaining resources. You explore the ship in search of salvageable items such as spare parts and materials, and use your ingenuity to create water and energy recycling systems.

The tutorial phase of the game will teach you how to move around the ship, pick up and craft items.

However, the ship takes a hit and crashes onto an unknown planet after wandering in space.

As you begin your new journey on this planet, you embark on a mission to collect soil, air, and water samples to analyze and determine if the planet is viable for humanity. The tutorial phase of the game will teach you how to analyze the soil.

The soil appears poor and dangerous, Jacob will have to fight to get the ship back in working order until he can take off from this planet and find another habitable planet. Jacob's survival depends on your ability to use limited resources efficiently and your determination to find a solution to leave this planet.

Get ready for an epic adventure as you fight for survival in the vast reaches of space. Visit Space Scape now and experience the thrill of survival in a hostile environment.

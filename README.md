## Hello there !
I'm [**@thomas-rooty**](https://github.com/thomas-rooty), and I'm the lead developer of Spacescape. I'm a French student in computer science, and I'm passionate about video games, web development and AI. I'm also a huge fan of space exploration, and I'm always looking for new ways to combine my passions.

## Synopsis

In the year 2300, Earth has reached its breaking point. Decades of environmental neglect, pollution, and wars have left the planet on the brink of collapse. In a desperate bid for survival, humanity turns its eyes to the stars, seeking a new home among the vast expanse of space.

"Spacescape" begins with the player witnessing the final days of Earth. Amidst this chaos, you board a state-of-the-art spaceship, your sights set on a distant, habitable planet. As you enter cryogenic sleep for the long journey ahead, a sense of hopeful anticipation fills the air.

However, destiny has a different plan.

You are jarringly awoken not by the gentle orbit of your new home, but by the blaring alarms and flashing red lights of an emergency. The cryogenic system has failed, and your ship is spiraling out of control, forcing an emergency landing on an uncharted planet.

As you step out into this alien world, you find yourself in a stark, barren landscape. With your spaceship damaged and no signs of life immediately apparent, survival becomes your primary goal. You must explore this mysterious planet, scavenge for resources, and uncover its hidden secrets.

But you are not alone.

In a twist of fate, this planet harbors other humans - like you, they have failed to reach their intended destination. Questions abound: Why have so many ships landed on this particular planet? What mysteries does it hold?

"Spacescape" is a journey of survival, discovery, and the unyielding human spirit. As you repair your ship and uncover the planet's secrets, you might just find the answers to why this cosmic coincidence occurred â€“ and what your true destiny may be.

# Development stage

### Socket.io to uWebSockets.js
I need to switch from Socket.io to uWebSockets.js. Socket.io is a great library, but it's not fast enough for a real-time multiplayer game. uWebSockets.js is much faster than Socket.io. I'm currently working on the switch and I hope to finish it soon !

### Migrated from cannon to rapier
I've moved from cannon to rapier for physics. Rapier is a physics engine written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly. It's faster and more stable than cannon which was a real pain in the ass to work with !
